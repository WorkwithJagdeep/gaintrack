# Gaintrack

## Project Description

Gaintrack is an open-source mobile trading application designed to empower you with the tools to navigate the stock market. Built with React Native (Expo) for a smooth user experience, Redux for efficient state management, and Firebase for secure user authentication, Gaintrack currently focuses on the front-end, offering the following functionalities:
## Features

- **Create Watchlists**: Build personalized watchlists by adding stocks you're interested in tracking.
- **Simulate Order Placement**: Experiment with simulated order placement to gain confidence before making real trades (backend functionality not yet implemented)
- **Create GTC Orders (Future)**: Plan your trading strategies with Good-Til-Canceled orders, valid for up to 1 year (backend functionality to be implemented in the future).
- **Access Stock Market News**: Stay informed with the latest developments impacting the market.
- **View Global Market Reports**: Gain valuable insights from comprehensive global market reports.


## Disclaimer:

Important Note: Currently, Gaintrack does not connect to real trading platforms and cannot execute actual trades. The order placement and GTC order features are purely for simulation purposes.
